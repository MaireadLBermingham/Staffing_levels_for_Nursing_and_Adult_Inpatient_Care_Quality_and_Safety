	abstract = {This evidence review was commissioned to support policy influencing and to point RCN
staff and members towards the latest evidence on staffing for safe and effective care.
A previous evidence review was completed to support RCN’s Staffing for Safe and Effective
Care (2019) report, with this current evidence review bringing that up to date.
The review summarises the most relevant evidence in nursing care settings on the topic of
safe staffing, including the impact of this on patient care across the settings of acute care
and primary and community care settings.
The recent review looked for a selection of published research articles and research reports
between January 2019 and October 2021. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature (CINAHL) and British Nursing Index (BNI) database were searched. The search
strategy focussed on safe staffing within nursing, the impact on patient care, and covered
all nursing care settings. The search terms included single words and a combination of
terms (complete list in Appendix 1).
This evidence review identifies research from the UK, USA and other countries across the
world. It is important for the UK to learn from countries where the research findings can
be transferable. The impact of these pressures identified in this research impact patient
outcomes, patient safety and the wellbeing of nursing staff.
The nursing workforce is critical in any health care system and has great capacity to avoid
or reduce adverse patient outcomes, such as mortality and morbidity (prevalence of
health condition), and to contribute to the wider productivity of an overall health system
(Sworn and Booth, 2019). Nursing provides high risk clinical care, 24/7.
A growing evidence base shows the impact of registered nurse staffing levels on the
quality of patient care and outcomes. The evidence demonstrates that having the right
number of appropriately qualified and experienced nurses is essential to protect patients
and the nursing profession moving forward. Nursing staff across the UK are working
under pressure to deliver patient care.
Overall, the evidence shows us that the patient outcomes affected the most by registered
nurse staffing numbers are mortality, care quality, missed care and adverse events (for
example, infection, pressure ulcers, medication errors). There is also evidence within study
findings of a positive association between an appropriately planned nursing skills mix and
patient safety outcomes (Sworn and Booth, 2019).},

KEY POINTS
 Provide an overview of Nurse staffing within ward areas
 Complies with the requirements relating to nurse staffing contained within Hard Truths:
The Journey to Putting Patients First
 The overall results for the Trust in June 2015 indicate that the authorised funded
establishment (AFE) for inpatient beds was 2515.15 Whole Time Equivalents (WTE)
 The SNCT data suggests that the required AFE was 2498.47 WTE giving a surplus of
16.68 WTE across the Trust
 Active on-going recruitment is underway to fill vacancies and the identified additional
posts required.},

	abstract = {The heavy workload of hospital nurses is a major problem for the American health care system. Nurses are experiencing higher workloads than ever before due to four main reasons: (1) increased demand for nurses, (2) inadequate supply of nurses, (3) reduced staffing and increased overtime, and (4) reduction in patient length of stay.

First, the demand for nurses is increasing as a result of population aging. Between 2000 and 2020, the United States population is expected to grow by 18 percent (31 million), but the over-65 population, with more health care needs, is expected to grow by 54 percent (19 million).1, 2 Second, the supply of nurses is not adequate to meet the current demand, and the shortage is projected to grow more severe as future demand increases and nursing schools are not able to keep up with the increasing educational demand.3, 4 When a nursing shortage occurs, the workload increases for those who remain on the job.5 Third, in response to increasing health care costs since the 1990s, hospitals reduced their nursing staffs and implemented mandatory overtime policies to meet unexpectedly high demands, which significantly increased nursing workloads. Fourth, increasing cost pressure forced health care organizations to reduce patient length of stay. As a result, hospital nurses today take care of patients who are sicker than in the past; therefore, their work is more intensive.6

There are several important consequences of high nursing workload. Research shows that a heavy nursing workload adversely affects patient safety.7 Furthermore, it negatively affects nursing job satisfaction and, as a result, contributes to high turnover and the nursing shortage.8 In addition to the higher patient acuity, work system factors and expectations also contribute to the nurses’ workload: nurses are expected to perform nonprofessional tasks such as delivering and retrieving food trays; housekeeping duties; transporting patients; and ordering, coordinating, or performing ancillary services.9 A 1998–1999 survey of more than 43,000 nurses in five countries found that 17 percent to 39 percent of respondents planned to leave their job within a year because of job demands.9 Heavy nursing workload increases burnout and job dissatisfaction, which in turn contributes to high nurse turnover.10 This chapter focuses on the impact of nursing workload on patient safety. We first present different concepts and models of nursing workload, then discuss the impact of workload on patients and on nursing staff, presenting various mechanisms of the relationship between nursing workload and patient safety. Finally, we describe a human factors engineering approach on how work systems can be redesigned to reduce nursing workload or to minimize the negative impact of a heavy nursing workload.},
