\section{Scenario}\label{scenario}}

Job applicants have been asked as part of the interview process for the
`Data and Measurement Advisory' role with Healthcare Improvement
Scotland (HIS) have been asked to analyse staffing levels data across
three Clinical areas collected daily by the Senior Charge Nurse, and to
present and discuss finding at hospital management meeting to discuss
safe staffing levels within Hospital X. Clinical area A and B are 25 and
30 bedded adult inpatient wards respectively. Bed capacity can be over
100\% due to admissions/discharges and the opening of surge beds where
available. All data, charts, images, documents and code associated with
this exercise can be accessed from

\subsection{Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Act
2019}\label{health-and-care-staffing-scotland-act-2019}}

The Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2019. Its
implementation was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All the
provisions within the Act will come into force in April 2024. The Act
was passed by Parliament in 2019, but implementation was paused due to
the pandemic. All the provisions within the Act will come into force in
April 2024. The aim of the Act is to be an enabler of high-quality care
and improved outcomes for service users of health service and care
services by ensuring appropriate staffing.

\hypertarget{general-duty}{%
\subsubsection{General duty}\label{general-duty}}

The Act places duties on health boards, care service providers,
Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS), the Care Inspectorate and
Scottish Ministers. to ensure appropriate staffing. As health
professionals, it is our duty to ensuring both appropriate numbers and
types of staff as necessary are working as appropriate for\\
* health, welling and safety of patients\\
* and provision of safe and high-quality care * staff well-being in so
far as it impacts the aforementioned conditions.\\
We are also required to submit quarterly Board reports, and to publish
and submit an annual report to the Scottish Ministers detailing how it
has carried out its duties under the following sections

Our \textbf{aim} is to ensure safe and high-quality care through
consistent data collection to scaffold improvement initiatives, and
facilitate mandatory reporting, maintain the proportion of registered
nurses as a percentage of total nursing staff above 65\%, and the whole
time equivalent (WTE) used meets or exceeds the WTE required to staff
the ward.

\hypertarget{adult-inpatient-care-journey}{%
\subsection{Adult inpatient care
journey}\label{adult-inpatient-care-journey}}

The patient will be referred by a GP or Accident and emergency service,
and will be admitted from outpatients or theater to the inpatient ward,
where a nurse will look after them and manage their pain. The patient
will be cared for by the healthcare team, which includes doctors,
nurses, healthcare assistants and others. Staff on the wards will be
working to a planned date for their discharge home or into community
care (Figure 1).

\hypertarget{the-nursing-process}{%
\subsection{The nursing process}\label{the-nursing-process}}

The nursing process is a methodical problem-solving approach used to
identify, prevent and treat actual or potential health issues and
promote well-being. It has five steps: assessment, diagnosis, planning,
implementation and evaluation (Figure 2)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-semachew2018ImplementationNursingProcess}{Semachew,

\hypertarget{dma-data}{%
\subsubsection{DMA data}\label{dma-data}}

The data provided as part of the Data and Measurement Advisory job
interview process will collected by a Senior staff nurse and her line
manager and team from Clinical areas, using the Professional Judgement
and Adult In-Patient tools. The tools are applied concurrently for at
least 2 weeks (14 consecutive days, with no intervening days)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-healthcareimprovementscotland2022AdultInpatientWorkload}{Scotland,
2022}).

\hypertarget{the-professional-judgement-tool}{%
\paragraph{The Professional Judgement
tool}\label{the-professional-judgement-tool}}

The Professional Judgement tool facilitates compliance with national
recommendations that Senior staff nurses and their line managers should
use this tool to determine staffing requirements, supporting an
evidence-based workforce planning.

\hypertarget{adult-in-patient}{%
\paragraph{Adult In-Patient}\label{adult-in-patient}}

The Adult In-Patient tool supports Senior staff nurses and their line
managers in making evidence‚Äêbased staffing levels decisions by assessing
patient dependency and/or acuity and nursing activity.

The data provided by the recruitment panel consists of a serious of
process measures of available staff, and patient care complexity data
(Table 1).

\includegraphics{./../../Output/Visuals/DataDictionary.png} \#\#\#\#
Measures of nursing care quality and performance However measures of
nursing care quality and performance across the Nursing process are not
included in the DMA data (Figure 2). I would like to propose to the
Senior staff nurse during the management meeting that we should be
making use of routinely collected nursing sensitive indicators to
determine whether nursing care quality and performance has an impact
patients (Table 2)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-oner2021NursingSensitiveIndicators}{Oner et al.,

There are no outcome measures included in the DMA data that directly
more improved performance or that we are working towards or stated aim
of ensuring safe and high quality care through \textbf{consistent data
collection} to scaffold improvement initiatives, and facile an mandatory
reporting, maintain the \textbf{proportion of registered nurses as
percentage of total nursing staff above 65\%}, and the \textbf{whole
time equivalent (WTE) used meets or exceeds the WTE required} to staff
the ward. I have there for used the process measures provided to
calculate three outcomes measures: * \textbf{Collection interval.} To
enable benchmarking, the Adult In-Patient and Professional Judgement
tools are applied for at least 2 weeks (14 consecutive days, with no
intervening days). * \textbf{Proportion of registered nurses (RN) as
percentage of total nursing staff.} To determine if the actual mix of
staff was appropriate to meet the needs of patients on the ward. The
benchmark average on general hospital wards is 65\% registered nurses
(Table 2)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-royalcollegeofnursingRCNPolicyUnit2006}{Nursing,

We need to look at the systems as a whole from different directions and
ensure that staffing improvements not causing problems in other parts of
the system. I would like to propose to the Senior staff nurse during the
management meeting that we should be making use of the routinely
collected staff turnover, sickness absence and agency spend balancing
measures to reflect what may be happening elsewhere in the system as a
result of the staffing improvements in the adult inpatient ward (Table
2) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ball2010GuidanceSafeNurse}{Ball, 2010}).

\hypertarget{updating-the-dma-exercise-data}{%
\section{Updating the DMA Exercise
data}\label{updating-the-dma-exercise-data}}

I develop accessible, transparent, time saving, data and measurement
handing pipelines, exploratory and downstream analyses and reports in
RMarkdown, and use GitHub version control to make it possible for
others, including my future self, to collaborate on projects and
reproduce results. Many stakeholder are not familiar with R nor
accessing project folder and documents via GitHub. I there for produce
less technical, code free reports, MS Excel Workbooks and PowerPoint
presentations as part of my workflow to facilitate collaboration with
less technical stakeholders.

In the `Scenario tab in the DMA Exercise data MS Excel file we were
informed that Clinical area A is a 25 bedded ward, and Clinical area B
is a 30 bedded ward. Furthermore we were told that bed capacity can be
over 100\% due to admissions/discharges and opening of surge beds where
available. This information was used information to populated the

I use the `lubricate' package to extract the day of the week from the
Date variable. `Lubridate' is an R package that makes it easier to work
with dates and times.

\end{verbatim}

Consistency of collection appears greater in Clinical area B based on
the frequency distribution of day of the week. There appears at first
glance to be a relationship between low week day counts in Clinical area
A and data collected in Clinical area A. Could it be that the team
misassigned the name of the clinical area.

There is only one of the three dates, the 11/1/2023 that you could infer
the the team may have misassigned the name of Clinical area B with C.
Before making this change, I would have to confirm this with the Senior
Charge Nurse. For the purpose, of the analyses for the upcoming meeting,
I will assume the data has been correctly assassinated to Clinical area
C. Data was collected at all three Clinical areas for the other two
dates.

\hypertarget{clinical-area-c}{%

Ward capacity details were not provided for Clinical area C. As such the
`\% area capacity currently in use' measure can not be calculated. Only
Clinical area A and B will be included in down stream analysis, and the
last three records in the data set from Clinical area C removed.
